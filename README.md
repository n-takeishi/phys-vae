## Prerequisite

- Python 3.8.3
- NumPy 1.19.2
- SciPy 1.5.2
- PyTorch 1.7.0
- pytorchvision 0.8.1 (for galaxy experiment)
- torchdiffeq (for pendulum/advdif/locomotion experiments)

## Usage

First, create data with `makedata.sh` or `makedata.m` in each data directory. You have to first download original data for the galaxy and locomotion datasets; see corresponding readme.txt.

You can train NN+phys(+reg) model using scripts [EXPTNAME]\_train.sh, for example by `. advdif_train.sh physnn`.
Then the .ipynb files perform some experiments shown in the paper.
